# My Little Cookbook App 

This is a very basic cookbook app where you can add your own recipes and create "cards" for each one. Choose a photo, name your recipe, add ingredients, and add any additional comments you want to be displayed on your little recipe card!

## Features

**Photos:** Currently there is an option to add a preset photo for your recipe to show the food genre. In the future there will be an option to add your own photo!

**Adding Ingredients:** Add your ingredients in one by one with many values of measurements to choose from! Happen to make a mistake? No worries! Each ingredients comes with their own delete button making removing extra or wrong ingredients easy!

**Comments:** Comments are optional! Use this section to add any tips or tricks you want to remember or share with others!

## Installation

First copy the cookbook github repository by using the `$ git clone https://github.com/jondmca/my-cookbook.git` command.

Once in the folder, run the `$ npm install` and `$ npm start` commands to open the cookbook in a localhost:3000 server.

Next run the command `json-server --watch db.json -p 3001` to run the json API server on localhost:3001 so it wont clash with the localhost holding the cookbook app!

## Roadmap

**Adding photos:** The next update to this application would be a user interface to submit and add personal photos to match the recipes content!

**Adding a sort/search function:** The more recipes that are added the more cluttered the application will get. So down the road it would be efficient to add a sort and search function to easily find the recipe you are lookoing for!

**Adding a share function:** Adding a "share" option would be great for those wanting to share their homemade recipes to their friends and loved one with ease. There would be an option to share a single recipe on each card allowing the user to send it out to whomever they please.
